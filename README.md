ZenPack from:

This tutorial will describe an efficient approach to monitoring data via a HTTP API. We’ll start by using zenpack.yaml to extend the Zenoss object model. Then we’ll use a Python modeler plugin to fill out the object model. Then we’ll use PythonCollector to monitor for events, datapoints and even to update the model.
